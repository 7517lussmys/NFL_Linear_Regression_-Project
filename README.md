# NFL Linear Regression Model With A  P-value Of 8.735e-08, Adjusted R-squared = 0.7666 And Multiple R-squared = 0.8012

### My goal for this project was to find the best reduced model for a dataframe containing NFL stats. In my judgment, the Y~ x2+x7+x8+x9 is the best subset model. This is because it has the highest Adjusted R-squared, and the second lowest cp score of 1.4, which is pretty low relative to the number of predictors. This was validated through forward and backward selection. This subset is better than using a full model because it reduces overfitting, increases efficiency and allows us to interpret the relationship between the predictors and the response variable. There are outside factors that would affect the ability of the model to predict future games, such as changes to rules, equipment and players. The models do have strong summary statics with a p-value of 8.735e-08, Adjusted R-squared = 0.7666 and Multiple R-squared = 0.8012. This model can be used for forecasting games within a couple of seasons, but after that it's tricky due to the constant change of factors.
